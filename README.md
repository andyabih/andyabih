# Why, hello there! :wave:

I'm a web developer based in [Beirut, Lebanon :hamburger:](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ec/8e/c5/ec8ec5f59a38a03cd1b9e84802ef51c8.jpg). I run [@yllw-digital](https://github.com/yllw-digital) with my partner [@joegabdelsater](https://github.com/joegabdelsater). I enjoy and mainly work with Laravel/Vue, but I also dabble in other technologies and languages from time to time, just to spice things up (looking at you, Go!).

* 💻 Currently, when I'm not working on client projects, I'm either learning about different technologies (right now that's Go), or working on side projects like Laravel Catapult (soon!), or CodeCandy (also, soon!).
* 👐 Absolutely love meeting new people, specially fellow developers, so please don't be shy, just contact me anywhere and I'd love to meet you.
* 🖌️ I would say I have an eye for UI/UX, not particularly an expert but definitely a field that I enjoy reading and learning about.
* 🎵 My true love in life is music. Currently, I would say two of my favorite artists are Phoebe Bridgers and Maggie Rogers.
* 🌙 I wanted to add the widget that tells you whether I'm a night owl or an early bird by tracking my commits, but I can tell you right now, I'm most definitely a night owl.
* 💃 I don't want to brag, but I sort of kind of danced with [Taylor Otwell](https://github.com/taylorotwell) once.
